The ASTM E741 method was additionally explored for estimating air change rates as a means of cross-verification. 
While this approach yielded values comparable to the exponential fitting method in the two-person occupancy case, 
notable deviations were observed in the single- and triple-occupant scenarios. 
These inconsistencies are likely due to inherent sensitivities of the ASTM method under low CO₂ differentials or non-uniform mixing conditions,
particularly during the early part of the buildup curve. 
Hence, the exponential fitting approach was adopted as the primary method for all reported analyses.
